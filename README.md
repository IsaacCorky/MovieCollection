# MovieCollection
IS 413 –HiltonAssignment #3
Our(pretend)client this week is Joel Hilton (my brother, who is 2 years, 2 months, and 2 days younger than myself), who is very into movies.  
.So into movies, in fact, that he minored in Film Studiesat BYU, contractsas a movie reviewer for ClearPlay, and does a weekly podcast about movies 
called Baconsale with a couple friends. He needs a systemto keep track of his movie collection.  
(He only allows movies he deems worthy into his collection... although when I asked him if it was okay if I used his spreadsheet as an example for 
my assignment this week, he asked me to make sure it’sunderstood that he married into some of these films.):)Currently, he is keeping track of the 
informationin a Google Doc:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXv5DQwyENjIlmzUx1ySZjprGUtbmxrxStSwELMSqf8/edit?usp=sharing
He needs a web app to be able to more easily enter and keep track of his movie collectionas it grows.  
Create a web app that has:
•A shared navigation menu to each page on the site
•A home page containing the title “The Joel Hilton Film Collection” and the only image I could find of him on the Internet:
ohttps://byu.box.com/s/p1d6uozvh4b8a5knyfo1dwzhhrp4mhd7
•A separate “My Podcasts” page with a link to the Baconsale site:https://baconsale.com/
•Aseparate page with a form to enter the movies.  

The new movie form should allow to enter all the information currently contained in the spreadsheet linked above.
Note:
oFor the Rating field, use a drop down menu (G, PG, PG-13, R).
oFor the Edited field, we want that to be a yes/no (true/false)option.
oThe “Edited”, “Lent To”, and “Notes” fields are optional.  

All other fields mustbe entered.oNotes should be limited to 25characters.
•A separate page that lists out all the movies that have been enteredso far(just while the app is running –we have not learned yet how to connect it 
to a database for long-term storage.)
oNOTE:  Exclude the movie “Independence Day” from ever displaying in the list, because Joel once argued in a 
4th of July podcast that “Independence Day” beats “Rocky IV” as the “Most American Movie Ever Made” which is obviously not true!
(#notcoveredinthevideos... but check out the section “DISPLAYING THE RESPONSES” in Chapter 3 of the Freeman textbookas a great place to start.)
